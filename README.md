        1. Detailed initial test-user as follows. Upon entering the site, users are expected to be welcomed with a friendly navigation bar to select which page they want to go and to find a teaser button to incentive them to interact with the training programs available. The actual result is the homepage automatically greeting with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is also a Hero Image with Text and a "Get Started" Call to action button which brings them to the Training Programs page. - Testing was performed to ensure the "call to action" button it's redirecting to each respective page. The outcome of the testing demonstrated that each "call to action" button is corresponding with each expected relevant content.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image as the objective with the input image is to hold the attention of the user in relation to the purpose of the website.  The actual result concerning the first impressions of the visitors with the background picture achieved the expected which was to indicate the website to be related to healthy exercises and training programs.
        3. The user has two options, click the call-to-action buttons, or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the Training Programs. The testing outcome was that all the call-to-action buttons were working fine leading to the Training Programs.

        2. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is. The form was also created to be fulfilled in full which means the form cannot be submitted unless the user completes each blank space requested. The implementation of the form has also been tested and the result is as expected.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to view the website on any mobile device in a clear ans easy way. - Testing was performed on all devices to ensure the Website was responsive.

        1. The website was designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page, there is a clean navigation bar, each link clearly describes the page on which they will end.

The result of those tests confirmed the fluidity of the site, ensuring that the user is free to browse without interruptions.

    4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are. -  The outcome of this testing process was the validation of the information given.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the "About".
